- A mobile-first application designed to leverage modern technologies, Tweet-Code enables coders to help each other by posting and reviewing solutions to coding problems. It fosters a collaborative community where users can share knowledge, provide feedback, and earn recognition for their contributions.

## Description

- <strong>Motivation:</strong> Our motivation for building TweetCode was to create a user-friendly and interactive platform where coders can help each other by posting and reviewing solutions to coding problems. The goal was to foster a collaborative environment that encourages sharing knowledge and providing feedback.
- <strong>Purpose:</strong> This project was developed to showcase skills in creating a mobile-first application that supports a vibrant coding community. It provides a platform for users to post their solutions, engage with others through comments, and earn recognition for their contributions.
- <strong>Problem Solved:</strong> TweetCode addresses the issue of static and less engaging coding forums by offering a dynamic platform where users can interact with each other's solutions, comment, and earn awards, fostering a more interactive and supportive coding community.
- <strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong> This project provided experience in building a mobile-first React application with features such as user interactions, comment sections, and award systems. It also involved enhancing skills in UI/UX design, front-end development, and creating a collaborative environment for knowledge sharing.
